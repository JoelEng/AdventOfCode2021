# Advent of Code 2021 :christmas_tree: :crab:

My solutions for Advent of Code 2021.

Project structure and setup kindly stolen from [AxlLind](https://github.com/AxlLind) and expanded upon.

## Usage

```sh
just run            # run all days
just run <DAYS>     # run one or more specific days

just get <DAY>      # fetch input and create .rs file from template
                    # input_examples/<DAY>.in has to be filled in manually
```

The token AOC_SESSION needs to be added to a .env file before use.
