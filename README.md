# Advent of Code 2020 :christmas_tree: :crab:

My solutions for Advent of Code 2020.

Project structure and setup kindly stolen from [AxlLind](https://github.com/AxlLind) and expanded upon.

## Usage

```sh
cargo run --release --bin <DAY> # run a specific day
cargo run --release             # run all days

./get <DAY>                     # fetch input and create .rs file
                                # input_examples/<DAY>.in has to be filled in manually
```

The token AOC_SESSION needs to be added to a .env file before use.
